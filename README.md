# Swiss SA food ideas

These are just for inspiration, as far as I know none of these dishes needs any strict recipes and everyone has some variation when it comes to these. Some also not traditionally from South Africa, but still popular - one perspective.

* A lot of south african omnivores leave the bacon out of this
* You can use any kind of souce for this, like the souce in the 'Pap' and 'sous' video. You are making a kind of lasagna with 'pap' and 'sous', with melted cheese on the top.

## Onions on embers

Place whole, unpeeled onions directly into hot wood embers after the fire has burned down to glowing coals. Cook for about 30–45 minutes, turning once or twice, until the skins are completely black and the onion feels very soft when pressed. Remove from the fire, allow to cool slightly, then peel away the charred outer layers to reveal a tender, sweet onion inside, ready to eat or season simply.

In South Africa, these ember-roasted onions are especially good when finished with **butter or margarine and a sprinkle of Aromat**. After peeling away the burnt skin, split the soft onion open, add a knob of butter or margarine, and season lightly with Aromat while the onion is still hot so it melts in and coats the layers, enhancing the natural sweetness with its savoury flavour.

Aromat is a savoury all-purpose seasoning made primarily from salt, monosodium glutamate (MSG), onion powder, garlic, yeast extract, and spices. It was originally developed in Switzerland by Knorr but has become deeply embedded in everyday cooking in South Africa.

In South Africa, Aromat is more than just a seasoning—it’s a pantry staple and cultural shorthand for comfort food. It’s commonly used on popcorn, chips (fries), eggs, avocado, roast vegetables, braaied meat, and simple dishes like ember-roasted onions. Many South Africans grow up with it, and its distinctive umami-rich flavour is closely associated with home cooking, braais, camping, and outdoor fire food. Saying “add Aromat” often implies a specific, familiar taste rather than just generic seasoning.
